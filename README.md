# Wi-Fi-CSI-based-HAR

Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) Based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) involves using the fine-grained information about wireless channel conditions to detect and classify human activities.

# Introduction

This repository presents a privacy-preserving Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) signals. Our approach leverages LSTM-based architecture to detect and classify activities such as 'idle', 'walking' and 'standing' with high accuracy, even in low-light scenarios. This non-vision-based method offers a secure alternative for applications in healthcare, workplace safety, and more.
